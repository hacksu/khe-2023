This is a website built with Next.js, which is a library that automatically turns React components into web pages. React components are reusable user interface elements. They are defined by functions that return HTML elements and/or other React components and automatically update themselves based on the variables within their internal state; React components can also be classes, but we are not planning on using those. We are using a bunch of existing React components defined by the library Mantine whenever possible to avoid having to write them ourselves. This website communicates with the server project by invoking the tRPC procedures it defines.

Next.js uses file system-based routing, which means that it automatically turns the components in the "pages" directory into... pages; except for the files \_app.tsx and \_document.tsx, which are special containers that go around the other pages. The rest of the directory structure is customizable.
