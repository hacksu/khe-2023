This project is a Node.js server program written in TypeScript that uses Express to manage user sessions, execute middleware (helper functions triggered for each incoming request), and provide a couple of simple routes. It defines procedures for handling communication with clients with the tRPC library. It defines schemas for the objects that will be passed back and forth between the client and the server with the zod library. It defines schemas for the objects that will be persistently stored in MongoDB with the mongoose library.

Note: while the project is in development, this program also creates a reverse proxy that makes pages from the other projects available at `localhost:5000` and `staff.localhost:5000`. During production, the same thing will be done by a faster program called nginx.
